## Summary ##
Web app for online raffles in which any user can host a raffle and others can join the draw. The person posting the raffle can set a prize, indicate maximum number of available slots, and setup the total price. The app will calculate the price per slot, and once this is all setup, and no more slots are left, the raffle begins immediately in real time. In this sense, users can take as many slots as they desire, and see which users joined to participate alongside them. In the end, the winner will be chosen in a way that mimics a spinning roulette.
